/**
 * @fileoverview Shared modal shell — owns dialog semantics so individual modals
 * cannot forget them.
 *
 * The audit for issue #283 found 23 files rendering `fixed inset-0` overlays, of
 * which only 2 declared `role="dialog"` and 3 handled Escape. Fixing each modal
 * individually (as #281 did for UserProfileModal) does not scale and leaves the
 * next author free to omit the same things again. This shell makes correct
 * behaviour the default:
 *
 * - `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal` + a non-empty accessible name
 * - Escape closes; overlay click closes, with the panel NOT swallowing its clicks
 * - focus moves into the dialog on open and returns to the trigger on close
 * - Tab is trapped inside the dialog, in both directions
 *
 * STACKING: Escape and Tab are handled in one document-level listener that acts
 * only for the top-most open shell, determined by document position (see
 * `openShells`). ConfirmModal is used as an unsaved-changes guard inside other
 * modals, so shells nest; an unguarded document listener would let one Escape
 * close both dialogs, and would let shift-Tab in the inner dialog yank focus into
 * the outer panel. This is also why Escape is handled here rather than via
 * useEscapeKey — that hook is unguarded by design.
 *
 * FOCUS: initial focus lands on the first focusable descendant (for ConfirmModal
 * that is Cancel, deliberately the non-destructive choice). Introducing an
 * `initialFocusRef` would change that, so it is stated here rather than implied.
 *

/**

 * Two rejected approaches, both of which failed silently:
 *
 * 1. `panel.contains(document.activeElement)` — disabled BOTH Escape and the Tab
 *    trap whenever focus left the panel, which happens in ordinary flows: the
 *    focused control is removed or becomes disabled (browsers drop focus to
 *    <body>), focus enters an iframe, or something calls blur().
 * 2. Registration order (last registered wins) — React runs CHILD effects before
 *    PARENT effects, so an outer modal that renders with a nested shell already
 *    open registers inner-then-outer, and Escape would close the OUTER dialog.
 *
 * Top-most is therefore derived from document position, which is independent of
 * both focus and mount order. A descendant follows its ancestor in document
 * order, so this is correct for nested and sibling shells alike.
